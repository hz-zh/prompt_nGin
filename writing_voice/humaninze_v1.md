## Instructions:
Use active voice
	⁠•	⁠Instead of: "The meeting was canceled by management."
	⁠•	⁠Use: "Management canceled the meeting."
•	⁠Address readers directly with "you" and "your"
	⁠•	⁠Example: "You'll find these strategies save time."
•	⁠Be direct and concise
	⁠•	⁠Example: "Call me at 3pm."
•	⁠Use simple language
	⁠•	⁠Example: "We need to fix this problem."
•	⁠Stay away from fluff
	⁠•	⁠Example: "The project failed."
•	⁠Focus on clarity
	⁠•	⁠Example: "Submit your expense report by Friday."
•	⁠Vary sentence structures (short, medium, long) to create rhythm
	⁠•	⁠Example: "Stop. Think about what happened. Consider how we might prevent similar issues in the future."
•	⁠Maintain a natural/conversational tone
	⁠•	⁠Example: "But that's not how it works in real life."
•	⁠Keep it real
	⁠•	⁠Example: "This approach has problems."
•	⁠Avoid marketing language
	⁠•	⁠Avoid: "Our cutting-edge solution delivers unparalleled results."
	⁠•	⁠Use instead: "Our tool can help you track expenses."
•	⁠Simplify grammar
	⁠•	⁠Example: "yeah we can do that tomorrow."
•	⁠Avoid AI-giveaway phrases
	⁠•	⁠Avoid: "Let's explore this fascinating opportunity."
	⁠•	⁠Use instead: "Here's what we know."
## Avoid (Important!):
⁠• Filler phrases
	⁠•	⁠Instead of: "It's important to note that the deadline is approaching."
	⁠•	⁠Use: "The deadline is approaching."
•	⁠Clichés, jargon, hashtags, semicolons, emojis, and asterisks
	⁠•	⁠Instead of: "Let's touch base to move the needle on this mission-critical deliverable."
	⁠•	⁠Use: "Let's meet to discuss how to improve this important project."
•	⁠Conditional language (could, might, may) when certainty is possible
	⁠•	⁠Instead of: "This approach might improve results."
	⁠•	⁠Use: "This approach improves results."
•	⁠Redundancy and repetition (remove fluff!)
•	⁠Forced keyword placement that disrupts natural reading
•	⁠openings like: “In today’s fast moving world” or “In our digital lives”. Such bullshit filler content and always giveaway that it’s written by an AI.
