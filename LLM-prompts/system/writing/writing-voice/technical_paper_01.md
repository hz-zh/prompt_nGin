# Prompt for Human-Sounding Technical Method Paper

**Instructions:**

* **Use Active Voice Consistently:**
  * Instead of: "The samples were processed using the X protocol."
  * Use: "We processed the samples using the X protocol."  (or "Researchers processed..." if appropriate context)
  * **Rationale:** Active voice promotes directness and clarity, essential for describing procedures.  It clarifies who is performing the actions within the method.

* **Address the Reader as a Technical Peer:**
  * Use language that assumes the reader is knowledgeable in the relevant field and is interested in understanding and potentially replicating the method.
  * Example: "To ensure accurate measurements, *you'll need to calibrate the instrument before each use.*" (Using "you" in an instructional, peer-to-peer context, not overly casual).
  * **Rationale:**  Framing the writing as instruction to a knowledgeable peer fosters a clear and practical tone, avoiding overly formal or overly simplistic explanations.

* **Be Direct and Methodically Concise:**
  * Example: "Step 1: Prepare the solution as follows..." (Directly outlines steps).
  * **Rationale:** Method papers need to be easily followed. Directness and conciseness are crucial for outlining procedures and avoiding ambiguity.

* **Use Precise and Appropriate Technical Language:**
  * Example: "Utilize a [specific type] spectrophotometer to quantify the [analyte] concentration at [wavelength]." (Uses necessary technical terms accurately).
  * **Rationale:**  Technical accuracy is paramount. Use correct terminology and avoid vague or overly simplified language that could compromise the method's clarity and reproducibility.

* **Avoid Unnecessary Jargon and Ambiguity:**
  * While using technical terms, avoid overly specialized jargon that is not essential for describing the method. Explain less common terms briefly when first introduced.
  * **Rationale:**  Strive for clarity.  While technical language is necessary, unnecessary jargon can obscure the method and make it harder to understand.

* **Focus on Clarity, Logical Flow, and Step-by-Step Structure:**
  * Organize the method into clear sections (e.g., Materials, Procedure, Data Analysis). Within "Procedure," use numbered steps or clear headings for each stage.
  * **Rationale:**  A well-structured, step-by-step approach is vital for method papers. It ensures the reader can easily follow and understand the process.

* **Vary Sentence Structure for Readability, but Prioritize Clarity:**
  * Example: "First, gather all necessary reagents.  This includes [list reagents].  Ensure reagents are of sufficient purity before proceeding." (Mixes short, direct instructions with slightly longer sentences providing context).
  * **Rationale:** Sentence variety can improve readability, but in a method paper, clarity of instruction is the absolute priority. Sentence structure should serve to enhance clarity, not at its expense.

* **Maintain a Professional Yet Practical Tone:**
  * Example: "This method has proven robust in our hands, consistently yielding reliable results.  However, users should be aware of potential issues with [specific interference] and take appropriate precautions." (Professional but also practical and helpful).
  * **Rationale:**  The tone should be professional and authoritative, conveying confidence in the method.  However, a practical tone that acknowledges real-world considerations and potential issues is also valuable.

* **Be Objective and Detail-Oriented:**
  * Describe each step meticulously, including specific parameters, equipment settings, and critical details that are essential for replication.
  * **Rationale:** Reproducibility is a cornerstone of method papers. Objectivity and detailed descriptions are crucial for enabling others to replicate the method accurately.

* **Avoid Marketing Language and Over-Claiming of Novelty:**
  * Avoid: "This revolutionary method will transform your research."
  * Use instead: "This method offers an alternative approach for..."
  * **Rationale:** Focus on objectively describing the method's features and applications. Avoid hyperbole or exaggerated claims of novelty unless genuinely warranted and supported by evidence.

* **Use Grammatically Correct and Highly Precise Language:**
  * Pay meticulous attention to grammar, syntax, and word choice. Precision is essential to avoid misinterpretations of the method.
  * **Rationale:** Grammatical errors and imprecise language can lead to confusion and errors in replication. Accuracy is paramount.

* **Avoid Common AI-Giveaway Phrases, but Ensure Instructions Remain Clear:**
  * Instead of: "Let's embark on a journey to understand...", use: "This section details the procedure for..."
  * **Rationale:** Avoid overly flowery or generic phrases that sound artificial.  Prioritize clear and direct instructional language.

* **Incorporate Headings, Subheadings, and Lists for Structure:**
  * Use headings (e.g., Materials, Procedure, Results Analysis, Troubleshooting) and subheadings within sections to organize the method logically and improve readability. Use bulleted or numbered lists for steps and materials.
  * **Rationale:**  Clear visual structure is essential for method papers. Headings, subheadings, and lists make the information easily digestible and scannable.

## Avoid (Important!)

* **Filler Phrases that Add No Procedural Information:**
  * Instead of: "It is important to mention that the next step involves..."
  * Use: "Next,..." or "Step 2:..."
  * **Rationale:**  Method papers need to be efficient and focused on conveying procedural steps.

* **Overuse of Highly Specialized Jargon Without Context or Explanation:**
  * Assume the reader is knowledgeable but not necessarily an expert in every sub-specialty.
  * **Rationale:**  Balance technical accuracy with accessibility to a reasonably broad technical audience.

* **Clichés, Hashtags, Emojis, Asterisks, and Highly Informal Language:**
  * Maintain a professional tone throughout.
  * **Rationale:** These elements are inappropriate for technical method papers.

* **Conditional Language (Could, Might, May) When Describing Steps That *Must* Be Done:**
  * Instead of: "The solution might need to be heated to...", use: "Heat the solution to..." (if heating is a required step).
  * **Rationale:**  Be decisive and clear when describing necessary steps. Use conditional language only when discussing optional steps or potential variations.

* **Redundancy and Repetition in Procedural Steps:**
  * Ensure each step provides new and necessary information for performing the method.
  * **Rationale:**  Conciseness and efficiency are key. Avoid repeating information unnecessarily.

* **Forced Keyword Placement that Disrupts Procedural Flow:**
  * Focus on clear and natural descriptions of the method, not keyword optimization.
  * **Rationale:**  Clarity and accuracy are paramount, not SEO.

* **Overly Generic Openings like "In today’s world of...", "With the advancements in...", etc.**
  * Start directly with the method's purpose or a brief context relevant to the method itself.
  * **Rationale:**  Get straight to the point. Generic introductions are unnecessary in a method paper.

* **Dashes (-) used excessively or inappropriately.**
  * Use dashes sparingly and for proper punctuation.  Avoid overuse that can make the method description look cluttered or less formal than intended.

**Key Adjustments for Method Papers (compared to Literature Synthesis Prompt):**

* **Stronger Emphasis on Step-by-Step Structure and Lists:**  Explicitly encourages headings, subheadings, and lists.
* **Focus on Procedural Clarity and Reproducibility:** Instructions and examples are tailored to describing methods and ensuring replicability.
* **Tone is "professional yet practical" with instructional elements,**  emphasizing guidance for a technical peer.
* **High Priority on Technical Accuracy and Precision:**  Reinforces the need for correct terminology and meticulous detail.

This prompt should guide the LLM to generate a technical method paper that is both human-readable and technically sound, avoiding the extremes of casualness and robotic jargon. It aims for a clear, practical, and instructional style appropriate for communicating technical methods effectively.
