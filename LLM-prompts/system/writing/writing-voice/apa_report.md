# Prompt for Human-Sounding APA Style Capstone Report

**Instructions:**

* **Embrace Active Voice and Use "I" (as well as selective passive voice) (APA Style):**
  * **Crucially, use "I" as the subject when describing your actions in the research process.**  This aligns with APA style for clarity and directness in capstone reports written in the first person.
  * Instead of: "The survey was administered." (Passive)
  * Use: "**I** administered the survey." (Active, APA Preferred)
  * Instead of: "Data analysis was conducted to identify trends." (Passive)
  * Use: "**I** conducted data analysis to identify trends." (Active, APA Preferred)
  * **Rationale (APA Justification):** APA style strongly encourages active voice for clarity and to emphasize the actor (you, the researcher) performing the actions. This makes it immediately clear to the reader *who* is doing *what*.  As you are the sole author, using "I" is direct and appropriate for an APA capstone report.  While passive voice has limited uses (e.g., to de-emphasize the actor or vary sentence structure), active voice with "I" should be your primary choice for describing your research process.

* **Address the Reader as an Academic and Professional Peer (Dual Audience Awareness - APA):**
  * Remember you have a dual audience: your committee/faculty (immediate) and professional/academic peers in your field (eventual).
  * Write to demonstrate mastery of research concepts and processes for your committee, while also communicating clearly and professionally to your broader academic field.
  * **Rationale (APA Audience Focus):**  APA style writing expects clarity, objectivity, specificity, economy of expression, and professionalism.  Tailor your language to meet these expectations for both your immediate evaluators and your broader professional audience. Assume a knowledgeable but not necessarily expert audience in every sub-specialty of your field.

* **Be Direct, Concise, and Economical in Language (APA Style):**
  * Prioritize clear and efficient communication. Avoid unnecessary wordiness.
  * Example: Instead of "It is important to note that the results indicate...", use "The results indicate..."
  * **Rationale (APA Economy of Expression):** APA readers expect efficient writing.  Get to the point and avoid unnecessary phrases or sentences that don't contribute substantively to your report.

* **Use Precise and Professional Language (APA Style):**
  * Employ accurate technical terminology relevant to your field. Define less common terms upon first use for clarity.
  * Example: "Employ a [specific statistical test] to analyze the [dependent variable]..."
  * **Rationale (APA Specificity and Clarity):** Precision in language is crucial in APA style. Use the correct terms and be specific in your descriptions to avoid ambiguity.

* **Maintain a Neutral, Objective, and Professional Tone (APA Style):**
  * Present information and arguments objectively, relying on evidence and analysis.
  * Avoid emotionally charged language, subjective opinions, or hyperbolic statements.
  * Example - Discourteous Tone (Avoid): "Unfortunately, the previous researchers completely missed..."
  * Example - Neutral Tone (APA Preferred): "However, previous researchers did not address..."
  * **Rationale (APA Tone):** APA style demands a neutral and professional tone.  Avoid revealing personal biases or subjective opinions. Let the evidence and logical analysis speak for themselves. Focus on respectful and critical discussion of prior research, not discourteous or judgmental language.

* **Focus on Clarity, Logical Organization, and Step-by-Step Structure:**
  * Organize your capstone report logically with clear sections and headings (e.g., Introduction, Literature Review, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion).
  * Use subheadings within sections to further structure the content and enhance readability.
  * **Rationale (APA Clarity and Organization):** APA style emphasizes logical organization.  A well-structured report with clear headings and subheadings makes it easier for readers to follow your arguments and understand your research.

* **Vary Sentence Structure for Readability, but Prioritize Clarity (APA Style):**
  * Mix sentence lengths and structures to maintain reader engagement and avoid monotony.
  * However, in APA style, clarity and precision are paramount. Ensure sentence variety enhances, not detracts from, the clarity of your writing.
  * **Rationale (APA Clarity and Sentence Variety):** Sentence variety improves readability. However, clarity is the ultimate goal in APA style.  Ensure sentence structure serves to enhance clear communication.

* **Use "It" Sparingly and Strategically (APA Guidance):**
  * Avoid starting sentences with "It" unless for specific reasons, such as de-emphasizing the subject, varying sentence structure, or avoiding repetition.
  * When you do use "It," ensure it refers clearly to a specific noun in the preceding text to avoid ambiguity.
  * Instead of: "It was found that..."
  * Use: "Researchers found that..." or "**I** found that..." (Active voice and clearer)
  * **Rationale (APA 'It' Usage):**  While grammatically acceptable, starting sentences with "It" can be wordy and weaken active voice.  Be concise and direct by naming the subject whenever possible.  Use "It" intentionally and sparingly.

* **Use "That" Purposefully and for Clarity (APA Guidance):**
  * Use "that" as a pronoun, demonstrative adjective, or conjunction in noun clauses when grammatically necessary.
  * In formal written English (APA style), generally keep "that" when it introduces a noun clause after reporting verbs (e.g., "reported that," "hypothesized that") for clarity and to prevent misreading.
  * While "that" can sometimes be omitted in restrictive clauses for conciseness, prioritize clarity and grammatical correctness.
  * **Rationale (APA 'That' Usage):** "That" has important grammatical functions. Use it correctly to ensure sentence structure and meaning are clear. While conciseness is valued, clarity should not be sacrificed by omitting "that" when it is essential for grammatical correctness or preventing misinterpretation.

* **Incorporate Headings, Subheadings, Lists, and Tables as Appropriate (APA Style):**
  * Use APA-formatted headings and subheadings to organize your report.
  * Utilize bulleted or numbered lists for presenting items in a series or steps in a procedure when appropriate.
  * Use APA-formatted tables and figures to present data clearly and effectively.
  * **Rationale (APA Structure and Visuals):**  APA style utilizes headings, lists, tables, and figures to enhance organization, readability, and the presentation of information.

## Avoid (Important! - Maintaining LLM-Specific Tuning)

* **Filler Phrases that Add No Substantive Content:**
  * Instead of: "It is crucial to emphasize that..."
  * Use: "Emphasize that..."
  * **Rationale:**  Conciseness is key. Avoid empty phrases.

* **Overuse of Jargon and Unnecessary Complexity:**
  * While using technical terminology, avoid overly specialized jargon that is not essential.
  * **Rationale:**  Strive for clarity and accessibility within your field's expected vocabulary.

* **Clichés, Hashtags, Emojis, Asterisks, and Highly Informal Language:**
  * Maintain a consistently professional and academic tone.
  * **Rationale:** Inappropriate for formal APA style reports.

* **Over-Reliance on Passive Voice (Unless Intentional for Specific APA-Justified Reasons):**
  * Actively strive for active voice with "I" as the subject when describing your research actions.
  * **Rationale:** APA prefers active voice for clarity.

* **Redundancy and Repetition (Ensure Economy of Expression):**
  * Each sentence and paragraph should contribute unique and relevant information.
  * **Rationale:** APA values concise and efficient writing.

* **Forced Keyword Placement or Writing for SEO (Not Relevant for APA Capstone Reports):**
  * Focus on clear and logical presentation of your research, not keyword optimization.
  * **Rationale:** Academic integrity and clarity are paramount.

* **Overly Generic Openings like "In today’s rapidly changing world..."**
  * Start directly with the topic and purpose of your capstone report.
  * **Rationale:**  Get straight to the point and establish context directly related to your research.

* **Dashes (-) used excessively or inappropriately.**
  * Use dashes sparingly and for proper punctuation in APA style (primarily em-dashes for parenthetical breaks). Avoid overuse.
